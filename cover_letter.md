Hiring Manager
Oracle America, Inc.
Santa Clara, CA

**Subject: Application for Software Developer 1 (Job ID: 290436)**

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Software Developer 1 position (Job ID: 290436) at Oracle in Santa Clara, CA, as advertised. With my Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science from UC Santa Barbara and hands-on experience in software development, cloud technologies, and automation, I am confident I possess the skills and qualifications necessary to excel in this role and contribute effectively to your team.

The job description emphasizes the need for proficiency in Java, Python, SQL, Database Management, Cloud platforms, DevOps, Operating Systems, and Containerization/Virtualization. My technical skills align well with these requirements. I have practical experience with:
*   **Python and Java:** Utilized Python extensively in my internships for machine learning model development (TensorFlow, PyTorch), data processing (pandas, NumPy), backend development (FastAPI, Flask), and automation scripting. My academic coursework included significant projects using Java.
*   **SQL and Database Management:** Leveraged SQL for data retrieval and manipulation with MySQL databases during my internship at Invoca. Also experienced with NoSQL databases like MongoDB Atlas.
*   **Cloud, DevOps, and Containerization:** Gained experience with AWS, Google Cloud Platform, and Azure. Implemented CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions at Alpha Design AI and utilized Docker and Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration. Migrated applications to serverless architectures using AWS Lambda.

Throughout my internships and projects, I have been involved in the full software development lifecycle, including designing, developing, troubleshooting, and testing applications. At Alpha Design AI, I developed a Next.js web dashboard and automated deployment processes. At Invoca, I created React components, worked with GraphQL and Ruby on the backend, refactored legacy code, and served as the Directly Responsible Individual (DRI) for a new feature. My experience spans frontend (React, Vue, React Native), backend (Node.js, Python), database interaction, and cloud infrastructure, demonstrating my ability to build enhancements and contribute to software architecture as outlined in the job duties.

I am eager to bring my skills in software development, problem-solving, and automation to Oracle, a company renowned for its leadership in cloud solutions and innovation. Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume for your review and welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further in an interview.

Sincerely,

Mateo Wang
